# Etch-A-Sketch

Another assignment for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). Rather than a hover event, I chose to go with a click event because that seemed more convenient for this kind of pixel art app. As for the design itself, what can I say ? I'm nostalgic for this kind of old school aesthetic and I thought it would be a nice exercise to try to recreate it with CSS.
